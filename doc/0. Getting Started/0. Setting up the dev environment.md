# Develop WordPress Locally

For this project, I'm using [ddev with wsl2 on windows](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/#wsl2-docker-ce-inside-install-script) for easier setup using the command line.

I used ddev [CMS Quickstarts for wordpress](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#wordpress-wp-cli):

```bash
mkdir my-wp-site && cd my-wp-site

# Create a new DDEV project inside the newly-created folder
# (Primary URL automatically set to `https://<folder>.ddev.site`)
ddev config --project-type=wordpress
ddev start

# Download WordPress
ddev wp core download

# Launch in browser to finish installation
ddev launch

# OR use the following installation command
# (we need to use single quotes to get the primary site URL from `.ddev/config.yaml` as variable)
ddev wp core install --url='$DDEV_PRIMARY_URL' --title='My WordPress site' --admin_user=admin --admin_password=admin --admin_email=admin@example.com

# Launch WordPress admin dashboard in your browser
ddev launch wp-admin/
```

Note: do NOT use docker desktop with ddev on wsl2, refresh times will be much longer than using docker directly inside wsl2 !

The course recommend using Local by Flywheel instead:

```bash
winget install Flywheel.Local
```

I use this to avoid tracking unrelevant files (`.gitignore` is managed by ddev, so I'm using `.git\info\exclude`) :

```txt title=".git\info\exclude"
# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~
# Wordpress - ignore core, configuration, examples, uploads and logs.
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/WordPress.gitignore

# Core
#
# Note: if you want to stage/commit WP core files
# you can delete this whole section/until Configuration.
