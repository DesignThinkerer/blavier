# Develop WordPress Locally

## Prerequisites

- PHP
- Apache or Nginx
- MySQL or MariaDB

Tools: XAMPP, MAMP, AMPPS, Bitnami WordPress, Local by Flywheel, ..

We will use https://localwp.com/. 

```bash
winget install Flywheel.Local
```
You might be unable to install local, in that case [MAMP](<1. Adding wordpress to MAMP.md>) is the recommended alternative.

Install php:

```bash
winget install php
```

On Linux and mac, you can use WP-CLI: [Getting Setup for Modern WordPress Development](https://youtu.be/v_Or9qtzKdE?si=sz3SGRYJHftkMlw1)
