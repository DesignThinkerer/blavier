### 1. Install MAMP

```

### 2. Activate Local Servers
- **Launch MAMP:** Open the application.
- **Start Servers:** Click on the “Start Servers” link to initiate Apache and MySQL.
- **Port Settings (Optional):**
  - **Default:** Apache runs on port 8888 (you’ll need to type it in your browser).
  - **Alternate:** Change the Apache port to 80 to simplify the URL (this requires your admin password).

### 3. Create a Database
- **Access phpMyAdmin:** From the MAMP start page, click on the phpMyAdmin tab.
- **Create Database:** 
  - Enter a name for your database (e.g., `WordPress` or a site-specific name).
  - Click “Create” to set up the database that will store your site’s content.

### 4. Install WordPress
- **Download WordPress:** Get the latest version from the [WordPress download page](https://wordpress.org/download/).
- **Setup Files:**
  - Unzip the WordPress package.
  - Move the entire WordPress folder to the `htdocs` directory in your MAMP installation.
    - **Mac:** Typically found in `Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`
    - **PC:** Usually located at `c:/MAMP/htdocs/`
- **Run the Install:**
  - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost/wordpress` (or `localhost:8888/wordpress` if using the default port).
  - **Language Selection:** Choose your language.
  - **Database Configuration:** Use the following details (most fields are pre-populated):
    - **Database Name:** The name you gave your database (e.g., `WordPress`)
    - **User Name:** `root`
    - **Password:** `root`
    - **Database Host:** `localhost`
    - **Table Prefix:** `wp_`
  - **Complete the Install:** Follow the on-screen prompts (the “famous five-minute install”) and enter your site details.
  - **Login:** Once installation is complete, log in to access your WordPress dashboard.
